Base SilverStripe set up to get new projects off the ground and going fast

## Instalation

When install if you plan on deploying this and don't want to worry about symlinks you'll want to set ```SS_VENDOR_METHOD``` in your environment to ```copy``` which will install the setup as copied files and not symlinks

```
export SS_VENDOR_METHOD=copy
composer install
```
